# MIS3690 Web Technologies - Term Project

## What is the Term Project?

The term project requires you to conceptualize, design, and implement a website. This is an individual effort. The website must be published using two hosts: (a) the internal server provided to you by Babson as part of this course and (b) an external hosting site such as GoDaddy or BlueHost. It is important that the hosting service you use must provide you with advertisement-free service (i.e., your webpages must not have advertisements and there must be no “pop-up” advertisements). You will be required to purchase a domain and pay a hosting-fee for the service, which might total to about \$15-\$40. These charges are separate from the tuition charges for the term (sort of like buying text books for a course). 

The project is to be developed throughout the term and completed in 2 intermediate stages plus the final submission. It also requires two different but related deliverables: the proposal document and the permissions document. The project must be completed and submitted to the instructor by the last day of class. All intermediate stages must be submitted on the day it is due. Each intermediate deliverable is graded and late submissions are penalized 3 points for every day it is late. Extensions may be granted at the instructor’s discretion provided you make the request before the due-date. Every deliverable is mandatory and has to be submitted, even if it is late.

## Examples of Term Project:

Your term project website may be based on any topic that conforms to Babson’s Policy on Terms of Use [http://www.babson.edu/privacy-policy/Pages/terms-of-use.aspx](http://www.babson.edu/privacy-policy/Pages/terms-of-use.aspx). Also remember that the course only addresses browser-side development. The course does not cover back-end databases, middleware or e-commerce. So, users will not be able to provide comments on your site that can be stored and retrieved later, upload images or multimedia to your website and, not be able to buy/sell products using your website. You can, however, design your site so that it can be extended to support these features at a later stage (beyond this course).

Examples of Term Projects (to give you a flavor):
1. travel2hk – a site dedicated to informing travelers about Hong Kong and its attractions. It includes night-life, dining options, sites to see, weather, fashion, and even a converter to covert temperature and currency (between Hong Kong currency and any other currencies of the world).
2. JRC Interiors – a website to support a family-owned interior design business. Besides information about the owners, it also presents a portfolio of projects completed, artwork available for sale and creative ideas for decorating your home/office.
3. The Jaucy Store – a website for making and selling clothing and accessories made from recycled products. It offers a catalog of products that the users can browse and insights into making some of these products.
4. Paulina’s DR – a site dedicated to highlighting the lifestyles of people in the Dominican Republic.
5. All About Red Sox – you guessed it and it even has video links to some best moments in history!
6. Tie-Off – a site for the Babson Tie-Off organization that helps international students in Babson improve their logical, analytical and persuasive skills. The site includes pictures from past events, information on how to become a member, events scheduled for the semester/year and details about their executive board.
7. Enzo Ferrari – a website dedicated to the life and inventions of Enzo Ferrari.
8. Trip of the Century – a complete description of places, sights, food and experiences of a student that traveled to Italy on a study-abroad program. It is designed for conveying the student’s perspective on the trip and includes a gallery of pictures that you can purchase. 

## Things You Cannot Do:
technologies that are covered in this course. Some items that are strictly prohibited are:
- Flash files unless you stream them directly from the source with permission from source.
- Server-side scripts (including PHP, except for mailer.php which is provided to you in this course).
- JavaScript files that you have not developed.
- CSS templates that are not customized – you need to customize it at least by removing all of the CSS elements that you have not used in your website pages.
- Website templates or pages developed by Content Management Systems (CMS) such as WordPress, Drupal or Joomla.

All the HTML codes must be your own (the only exceptions are the tags used by a CSS template that you have used for your webpage(s)).

## Getting Started
To start your project, you need to create a new repository in GitHub. Add me([zli@babson.edu](zli@babson.edu)) as a collaborator on GitHub for that repo.
